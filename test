Guidelines for your final presentations have been on iLearn.

Few additional things to note:

1. I will be strictly going by the class roster to call you up for your presentation (its alphabetical by last name). If you are not ready/available, you will be considered to have missed your chance. Attendance during these presentations is mandatory.

2. You can submit your project report tomorrow. However, to give you more time, I am also ok if you submit next Wednesday in class. If you make a presentation tomorrow, you are of course allowed to further improve/expand/fix your project before you submit next week.

3. I will be very strict with time limits; so be sure that you do not waste your time in setting-up. In particular, have necessary adapters etc. Also, placing multiple presentations on a single laptop is ok. The first speaker(s) are encouraged to come a few minutes early and set-up.
